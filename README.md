## car-sales

### Introduction
This project is on car sales analysis that can help to understand the factors influencing sales and make informed business decisions. This project aims to demonstrate the process of data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling using Python.

### Features 
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization
- Feature engineering
- Regression analysis
- Correlation Analysis

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the sale price of cars, roughly 50 features, and approximately 200,000 records. The dataset is available as one of the files in this repository.

### Regression and Correlation Analysis
In this project, I use the regression model to predict car sales based on horsepower, mileage, fuel economy, and many other features. It is important to note that the particular interest of this analysis was to look at cars equal or below 100,000. The correlation analysis shows how some variables in the study are related.
